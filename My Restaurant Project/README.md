# Python Mini Apps

Today is just about trying some things out and getting interact with different types of data. You'll be making a simple console app using the data provided that users can interact with. Below is a list of the data that is available and some ideas to get you started. You can either choose an idea from this list or get creative and come up with your own idea, (just try to keep it relatively simple.)

Start off with the core functionality of the console app to get it working, and then think about additional features you can add. Building a CLI app in Python shouldn't need any external packages (even though there are some). There are some great built in functions to help you do this.

Take a look at the documentation for:

```
input()
```

-   [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input)
-   [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp)
-   [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-input-function/)

Once you are happy you can move onto another data file to get some practice with that too!

### External Packages

---

There is a lot you can do in python without needing the help of external modules. But you may find you need a helping hand. Below are some suggestions and their documentation. Don't be afraid to have a look into other methods and have a good read of their documentation.

-   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
-   [PyYaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
    <br />

### CSV data

---

-   You have been provided with multiple CSV files that contain restaurant data. Each file has an item with prices, descriptions and additional information.

_Idea_

-   You can create a console diner, where the user asks for items and is then charged for the items. You can include a cash register that contains a history of what has been purchased and manages stocks.

### JSON data

---

-   You have been provided with a JSON file that contains a list of people and equipment, with each having other additional information.

_Idea_

-   Create a choose your own adventure console game, where the user can interact with NPCs, travel through rooms, use equipment. You could include functionality for a shop, battling, finding treasures.

### XML data

---

-   Here you have been provided with an XML file in the form of a list of properties. Each property is split into categories and contains information about each.

_Idea_

-   With this data you could create a console realtor business, the user describes the property they are looking for and you can find them their dream home!

### YAML data

---

-   This YAML data contains some people looking for love. Each person has interests, wants, along with some more info.

_Idea_

-   Make a console app that a user can find out more information about singles looking to mingle. The user likes the sea? I heard a fisherman recently signed up!

### These are just ideas!

---

The data provided is what you will typically be working with, this sprint is for you to get used to interacting and using these kinds of data files.

If none of these take your fancy then feel free to find your own data!

The ideas above are just ideas and are there to get you thinking about some of the console creations you can make, run with them or come up with your own!

### Resources

---

Each section of this readme provides a link to some relevant documentation that will help you interact with each data file.
