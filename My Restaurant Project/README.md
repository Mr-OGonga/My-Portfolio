# Python Mini-App

This is a restaurant mini-app that displays 5 different menus one by one - drinks, starters, pastas, pizzas and desserts - and then asks the user to choose which items from each they would like to eat for their meal. Customers can choose multiple items per course, the same item multiple times or nothing if they would like. At the end, there is an option to pay your bill and add a tip. Finally, the total bill is added up and displayed on a formatted bill listing each of the items that have been ordered.

The data is pulled from multiple CSV files which are read and then formatted so individual items can be used separately with 


### CSV data

---

-   You have been provided with multiple CSV files that contain restaurant data. Each file has an item with prices, descriptions and additional information.

_Idea_

-   You can create a console diner, where the user asks for items and is then charged for the items. You can include a cash register that contains a history of what has been purchased and manages stocks.
